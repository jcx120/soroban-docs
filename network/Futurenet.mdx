Futurenet is available as the first shared test network to enable developers to learn, tinker and build applications on Soroban while being able to interact with other participants. 


:::Caution
Futurenet can be reset at any time due to new code deployments. 

All components of Futurenet such as the [RPC Server] and the Core Soroban network are in active development and will be unstable at times. They should be treated as development releases with no production capabilities, API or backward compatibility guarantees.
